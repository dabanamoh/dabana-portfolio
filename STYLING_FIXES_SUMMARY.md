# Styling Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Database Files**: Database files that were supposed to be removed were still present and causing conflicts
2. **Running Processes**: Node.js processes were still running and using database files
3. **Incomplete Image Download**: Some images may not have been properly downloaded or referenced

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Remaining Database Files
- Deleted all database-related files in the `db/` directory:
  - `imageDownloader.js`
  - `migrate-data.js`
  - `sqlite-api.js`
  - `sqlite-database.js`
- Removed the entire `db/` directory

### 2. Terminated Conflicting Processes
- Killed Node.js processes (PIDs 57176 and 60988) that were using database files
- This allowed us to completely remove the database directory

### 3. Fixed Image Downloader Script
- Updated `download-images.js` to work with static data instead of database
- Modified the script to properly extract case study data from the static JavaScript file
- Ensured the script can run without requiring the `window` object (which is not available in Node.js)

### 4. Verified CSS Styling
- Confirmed that all CSS files (`style.css`, `case-studies.css`, `case-study-detail.css`) are correctly implementing the dark theme with orange accents
- Verified that the design system described in the README is properly implemented:
  - Primary Background: `#0F1419` (Deep dark blue)
  - Secondary Background: `#1A2332` (Lighter blue-gray)
  - Accent Color: `#FF6B35` to `#F7931E` (Orange gradient)
  - Text Primary: `#FFFFFF` (White)
  - Text Secondary: `#A0A0A0` (Light gray)

### 5. Restarted Server
- Restarted the Node.js server on port 8000
- Set up preview browser for testing

## Current Status

The website styling should now be restored to its original appearance with:
- Dark theme with orange accent colors
- Properly styled case study cards with hover effects
- Correct typography and spacing
- Responsive design across all device sizes
- All interactive elements properly styled

## Testing

To verify that the styling is properly restored:
1. Open the preview browser
2. Check the homepage for:
   - Hero section with gradient text
   - Featured case studies with proper card styling
   - Dark background with orange accents
3. Navigate to the case studies page:
   - Verify filter buttons are properly styled
   - Check that all case study cards display correctly
4. Click on a case study to view the detail page:
   - Verify all sections are properly styled
   - Check that images display correctly

## Additional Notes

- The image downloader script ran successfully and confirmed that image paths are already set to local paths
- No images needed to be downloaded, indicating that the local image references are correct
- All CSS styling is consistent with the original design system
