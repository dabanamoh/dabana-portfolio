overview: |
  MediConnect Ghana, the country's leading healthcare booking platform, was experiencing declining user engagement and high churn rates despite growing market demand for digital healthcare services. Users were abandoning the platform during the booking process, and feedback indicated frustration with the complex interface.

  I led a comprehensive UX research and redesign project to transform the platform into an intuitive, accessible, and culturally appropriate healthcare solution. The project required deep understanding of diverse user demographics, healthcare provider workflows, and local healthcare practices.

  ### Redesign Focus Areas

  - User journey optimization from search to appointment completion
  - Accessibility improvements for diverse user capabilities
  - Mobile-first design for Ghana's mobile-dominant market
  - Cultural adaptation for local healthcare preferences
  - Provider dashboard enhancement for medical professionals
challenge: |
  The UX challenges were complex and multifaceted:

  - **Complex User Journey:** The booking process involved 8+ steps with confusing navigation and unclear information hierarchy.
  - **Accessibility Barriers:** Platform wasn't accessible to users with visual impairments or limited digital literacy.
  - **Cultural Disconnect:** Interface didn't reflect local healthcare practices or cultural expectations around medical care.
  - **Mobile Experience:** Poor mobile experience despite 85% of users accessing via mobile devices.
  - **Provider Frustration:** Healthcare providers struggled with the complex dashboard for managing appointments and patient information.
  - **Trust Issues:** Users expressed concerns about data privacy and platform credibility.
solution: |
  I implemented a user-centered redesign strategy:

  - **Extensive User Research:** Conducted 50+ user interviews, usability testing sessions, and cultural immersion research across Ghana.
  - **Simplified User Journey:** Reduced booking process from 8 steps to 3, with clear progress indicators and contextual help.
  - **Accessibility First:** Implemented WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support, high contrast modes, and large touch targets.
  - **Cultural Adaptation:** Integrated local languages, culturally appropriate imagery, and healthcare practices familiar to Ghanaian users.
  - **Mobile-First Design:** Completely rebuilt mobile experience with touch-optimized interactions and offline capabilities.
  - **Trust Building:** Added provider verification badges, patient reviews, and clear privacy communications.
results: |
  The UX redesign delivered exceptional improvements across all key metrics:

  **User Engagement:** User engagement increased by 75% with session duration rising from 3 minutes to 8 minutes average. Users now complete the booking process at a 68% higher rate.

  **Accessibility Impact:** The platform now serves users with visual impairments and limited digital literacy, expanding the user base by 30% and receiving recognition from Ghana's Disability Rights advocacy groups.

  **Business Growth:** Appointment bookings increased by 50%, and the platform's Net Promoter Score improved from 32 to 71, indicating strong user satisfaction and likelihood to recommend.
