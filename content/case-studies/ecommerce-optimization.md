overview: |
  AfriShop Kenya, one of East Africa's largest e-commerce platforms, was experiencing declining conversion rates and increased customer churn despite growing traffic. Their platform, built three years prior, had become outdated with poor mobile experience and complex checkout processes.

  As the lead product manager, I conducted comprehensive user research, analyzed platform performance data, and developed a strategic roadmap to modernize the platform. The project involved redesigning the entire user journey, implementing advanced analytics, and optimizing for mobile-first commerce.

  ### Strategic Focus Areas

  - Mobile-first user experience design
  - Simplified checkout and payment processes
  - Personalized product recommendations
  - Performance optimization and speed improvements
  - Advanced analytics and conversion tracking
challenge: |
  Key challenges identified through user research and data analysis:

  - **Poor Mobile Experience:** 70% of traffic was mobile, but conversion rate was only 1.2% compared to 4.8% on desktop.
  - **Complex Checkout:** 68% cart abandonment rate with average 7-step checkout process.
  - **Slow Performance:** Average page load time of 8.3 seconds causing high bounce rates.
  - **Limited Payment Options:** Only supported 3 payment methods in a market with diverse payment preferences.
  - **Poor Search & Discovery:** Users couldn't find products easily, with 45% of searches returning no results.
  - **Lack of Personalization:** Generic experience for all users with no product recommendations.

  I implemented a comprehensive platform optimization strategy:

  - **Mobile-First Redesign:** Completely rebuilt the mobile interface with touch-optimized navigation and responsive design.
  - **Streamlined Checkout:** Reduced checkout from 7 steps to 3, implemented guest checkout, and added one-click purchasing.
  - **Performance Optimization:** Implemented CDN, image optimization, and lazy loading to achieve sub-4 second load times.
  - **Enhanced Payment Gateway:** Integrated 8 popular payment methods including mobile money, bank transfers, and digital wallets.
  - **AI-Powered Search:** Implemented intelligent search with auto-complete, spell correction, and visual search capabilities.
  - **Personalization Engine:** Built recommendation system using collaborative filtering and browsing behavior analysis.

  The e-commerce optimization project delivered exceptional results that transformed AfriShop Kenya's business:

  **Revenue Growth:** The platform generated an additional $2M in revenue within the first year, with a 60% increase in overall conversion rates and a 45% improvement in customer retention.

  **User Experience:** Mobile conversion rates improved from 1.2% to 3.8%, and page load times decreased from 8.3 seconds to 3.2 seconds. Cart abandonment dropped from 68% to 32%.

  **Business Scalability:** The optimized platform now handles 3x more traffic with improved performance, and the personalization engine drives 35% of all sales through recommendations.
